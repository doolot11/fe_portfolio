            My name is Doolotbek, and I am a Full Stack Developer and UI/UX designer. On the frontend, I work with React JS, Next JS, JavaScript,
            and TypeScript, while on the backend, I have experience with Node JS, Express JS, REST APIs, and databases (MySQL, MongoDB). In UI/UX design,
            I have extensive knowledge of tools such as Figma, Adobe Photoshop, and Illustrator. In project implementation, I possess a broad perspective,
            ranging from coding to designing and conceptualizing user interfaces. I am committed to teamwork and continuous learning,
            and I quickly adapt to new technologies. I strive to solve problems
            and deliver effective projects. My primary goal is to create functional, aesthetically pleasing, and user-friendly products.
